# Console Warnings - Non-Critical Issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **These warnings are expected and don't affect functionality:**

### 1. **WalletConnect Configuration Warning**
```
Origin http://localhost:3000 not found on Allowlist - update configuration on cloud.reown.com
```
**Why:** We're using a placeholder project ID for development
**Impact:** None - wallet connection works perfectly
**Fix:** Not needed for development/testing

### 2. **Module Resolution Warnings**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage'
Module not found: Can't resolve 'pino-pretty'
```
**Why:** These are optional dependencies for mobile/React Native features
**Impact:** None - web functionality works fine
**Status:** Fixed by installing missing dependencies

### 3. **WalletConnect Core Initialization**
```
WalletConnect Core is already initialized. This is probably a mistake
```
**Why:** Hot reloading in development causes multiple initializations
**Impact:** None - works correctly in production
**Fix:** Normal in development mode

### 4. **Reown Config 403 Error**
```
[Reown Config] Failed to fetch remote project configuration. Using local/default values.
```
**Why:** Using placeholder project ID
**Impact:** None - falls back to local configuration
**Fix:** Not needed for development
